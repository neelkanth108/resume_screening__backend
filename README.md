- Upload and screen resumes (PDF, DOCX)
- Auto-extract skills, name, email, experience, and score
- Store parsed results in a database
- Email the screening result to candidates
- Firebase-based Admin Authentication
- Filter logs by status and job
- Lightweight and ready for deployment

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- SQLite + SQLAlchemy + Databases
- Firebase Admin SDK
- PDFPlumber, python-docx, pyresparser
- NLP: spaCy, nltk, sentence-transformers

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/resume_screening_backend.git
cd resume_screening_backend
````

### 2. Create virtual environment and activate it

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix/macOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add `.env` file

Create a `.env` file with environment variables like:

```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./resumes.db
FIREBASE_CREDENTIAL_PATH=firebase-adminsdk.json
```

### 5. Add Firebase service account key

Place your `firebase-adminsdk.json` in the root folder (but **do not commit** it to GitHub).

---

## ▶️ Running the Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## 🛡️ Security & Notes

* Make sure `firebase-adminsdk.json` is ignored via `.gitignore`
* API authentication uses Firebase JWT
* Use HTTPS when deploying
* Do not expose `/screen` or `/logs` endpoints publicly without auth

---

## 🚀 Deployment

You can deploy this backend using:

* **Render** (free tier supports FastAPI)
* **Railway.app**
* **Fly.io**
* **Heroku (via Docker)**
* **EC2 / VPS** (manual uvicorn/gunicorn + nginx)

### 🔁 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- Add Docker support for containerized deployment
- Add unit tests (e.g., using `pytest`)
- Setup CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Add rate limiting, CORS rules

Would you like me to generate the same README for the frontend repo next?
